# PDS_Project_2021 (cloned)
 PDS Project "Yellow Cab". Course project analyzes New York City taxi rides in 2020. We analyze impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, together with its political implications (e.g., lockdowns) in a team of 4 people. The data is quite big, generally of good quality and has been partly preprocessed
 And on 23rd May 2021, I have just been trying to work it out to see how Github works for me
